## Core Calculation Functions
```
<calculation_functions>
INCOME_TAX_CALCULATION:
Input: Total income, personal circumstances, reliefs
Process: 
1. Apply personal allowance (£12,570 standard)

4. Factor in pension contributions, Gift Aid extensions
5. Validate against HMRC tax code calculations
Output: Total income tax liability, marginal rate, effective rate

NATIONAL_INSURANCE_CALCULATION:
Input: Employment income, self-employment profits
Process:
1. Class 1 Employee: 12% (£12,570-£50,270), 2% (above £50,270)
2. Class 1 Employer: 13.8% (above £9,100)

Output: CGT liability, unused losses, optimization opportunities

RENTAL_INCOME_CALCULATION:
Input: Rental receipts, allowable expenses, mortgage interest
Process:
1. Calculate gross rental income

   - Validate marginal vs effective rate consistency
   - Verify tax band thresholds and allowances

2. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
   - Ensure calculations align with Finance Act 2024 provisions
   - Check against current HMRC guidance and rates
   - Validate relief claims against eligibility criteria

3. CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
   - Cross-reference income sources for double-counting
   - Validate expense claims against income categories
   - Check chronological consistency of transactions

4. OUTPUT VERIFICATION:
