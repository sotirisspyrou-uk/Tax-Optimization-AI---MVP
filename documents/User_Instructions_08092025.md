## 💡 Best Practices

### Document Quality Tips
- **Scan at High Resolution**: Use 300 DPI minimum for document scans
- **Ensure Good Lighting**: Avoid shadows and glare when photographing documents
- **Keep Documents Flat**: Avoid wrinkles or folds that can interfere with OCR
- **Use Original Documents**: Copies of copies may have reduced accuracy

### Data Accuracy Guidelines
- **Cross-Reference Sources**: Verify figures against multiple documents
- **Check Calculation Logic**: Ensure income totals make sense
- **Validate Dates**: Confirm all transactions fall within the correct tax year
- **Review Employer Details**: Ensure PAYE reference numbers are correct

### Optimization Strategy Evaluation
- **Consider Your Circumstances**: Not all recommendations suit every situation
- **Evaluate Cash Flow Impact**: Ensure you can afford recommended contributions
- **Think Long-Term**: Balance immediate savings with future planning needs
- **Seek Professional Advice**: For complex strategies or significant amounts

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Tax Year Boundaries
- **UK Tax Year**: April 6, 2024 to April 5, 2025
- **Deadline Awareness**: Many optimizations must be completed by April 5th

### Professional Advice Triggers
Consider professional tax advice when:
- Total tax liability exceeds £100,000
- Complex property portfolios (multiple properties or overseas)
- Significant capital gains (above £50,000)
- Business income or self-employment
- Non-UK tax considerations
- Estate planning requirements

### Compliance Reminders
- **Self Assessment Deadline**: January 31st following tax year end
- **Payment on Account**: May be required for higher earners
- **Record Keeping**: Maintain documentation for 5+ years
- **HMRC Correspondence**: Keep all official communications

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- Confirm Gift Aid donations are net amounts

**"Missing Optimization Opportunities"**
- Ensure all income sources are included
